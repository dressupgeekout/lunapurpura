# CLU format

A CLU file implements a color lookup table (sometimes called a CLUT). Every
CLU file is exactly the same length (2056 bytes) because each one specifies
the same number of colors (256).

XPK graphics rely on a CLU to determine the RGB values for a given pixel.
The index is zero-based, thus each color in a CLU is numerically identified
from 0 through 255.




## Games which are demonstrated to use this format
